<h1 style="font-weight: bold" >Spraywall Bookmark</h1>

<p>Spraywall Bookmark is an Android and iOS application designed to enhance your climbing experience. It allows you to bookmark routes on a virtual spraywall, track your progress, and explore routes set by other climbers at different gyms.</p>

## Features
- **Bookmark routes:** With Spraywall Bookmark, you can upload an image of a spraywall from your gym, house or climbing area. You can then set routes on the spraywall image by drawing lines or shapes over the holds or grips you want to bookmark. This feature allows you to easily keep track of the routes you have climbed or want to climb.

- **Progress tracking:** Once you have bookmarked a route, you can update your progress on that route, such as whether you have sent it or if you're still working on it. This feature helps you visualize your climbing achievements and goals.

- **Explore other gyms:** Spraywall Bookmark also provides a platform for climbers to share their spraywall routes with others. You can explore routes set by climbers at different gyms and get inspired by their creativity. This feature fosters a sense of community and provides opportunities for climbers to connect and exchange route ideas.
